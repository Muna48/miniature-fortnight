# Horiseon Company Website


## Description 
This website was built for the company Horiseaon to provide information on the different products/service that the company offers. The website already existed, and our task was to improve the code currently in place. I have done this by adding semantic html elements, adding alt/title attribute to improve search engine optomisation, consolidating headings/classes as well as ensuring that all links work.
